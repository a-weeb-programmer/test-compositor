# My test compositor
So, I am already developing a compositor, it's called [Corrosionwm](https://github.com/corrosionwm/corrosionwm), but this project is in my total control
and will be used to reinforce my understanding of the wayland protocol without screwing up corrosionwm in the process since this is a separate project.
If you want to use this daily, WHY, and also, don't lmao
